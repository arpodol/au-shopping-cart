# AU Shopping Cart
AU Shopping Cart Full Stack project using React front-end, Express back-end and MongoDb for DB. 
When an individual navigates to the page for the first time, a cookie is created as well as a corresponding cart. 
An individual can only add as much products to their cart as there are products in stock. Checking out will update products as well as empty out the cart.
There is a restock button that adds 5 more to the quantity of each for testing sake.

# To Run
In root run  <code>docker-compose up</code> and navigate to <code>localhost:3000</code>
